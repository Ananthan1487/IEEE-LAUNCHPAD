### About Me

>I love technology and have a strong desire to comprehend how things operate. I like to experiment with computers, devices, and systems, and I'm constantly interested in how technology works. I enjoy the challenge and excitement that technology offers, whether it's problem-solving, learning new tools, or trying out concepts.

In addition, I'm a creative thinker who likes to design and draw. Particularly while working on technological problems, my inventiveness enables me to think creatively and come up with original ideas. I think true innovation results from fusing technical know-how with creativity.

In addition, I'm amiable, upbeat, and always ready for a good laugh. I want to keep things entertaining, share ideas, and assist people. Whatever I'm doing, I approach life with enthusiasm, curiosity, and an open mind.

#### Leadership and Influence:

-I am able to unite people and lead teams toward common objectives because of my great leadership and influence abilities. I listen intently, speak effectively, and ensure that everyone feels appreciated and heard. I like inspiring others, working with others to solve challenges, and fostering an atmosphere that encourages creativity. I lead by example with a positive attitude and a strong work ethic, and people find it easy to connect with me because of my amiable and witty nature. I try to motivate people and have a significant influence, whether in a group project or in my everyday life.


#### Networking:

- My ability to network effectively enables me to establish sincere relationships with individuals from a variety of backgrounds. Whether in a business or informal context, I'm personable, amiable, and always willing to talk. I like exchanging ideas, learning from people, and identifying points of agreement that might result in fruitful partnerships. My curiosity sparks deeper discussions, while my upbeat demeanor and sense of humor aid in establishing rapport. In my opinion, networking is about developing mutual trust, opening doors, and developing as a team rather than only swapping contacts. I try to make a good first impression, whether I'm interacting with someone in person or online.


#### Career Plan:

- After earning my engineering degree, I intend to get an MBA. I think there will be more chances for leadership and creativity if technical expertise and managerial abilities are combined. I'm particularly interested in learning more about circuit boards and electronics, and I hope to work on hands-on projects that could lead to valuable ideas. I intend to develop solutions that are useful and significant by expanding my technical proficiency and fortifying my grasp of business. My objective is to create something significant that can actually change the world by combining strategy, technology, and creativity.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech ecosystem stands out as one of India’s most strategic, sustainable, and people-centric. It’s driven by talent rather than hype, with a strong focus on quality and long-term growth. The state consistently produces skilled professionals, many of whom once migrated elsewhere for opportunities. However, with improved infrastructure and a higher quality of life, more talent is now choosing to return or work remotely from Kerala, contributing to its growing reputation as a tech-friendly destination.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I engage with my community by volunteering, mentoring peers, and sharing my knowledge in tech and design. I enjoy supporting local events, promoting skill development, and helping others grow through collaboration, creativity, and meaningful connections.
